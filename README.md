# Boat Sales Data Analysis

This repository contains code and notebooks for analyzing boat sales data. It includes scripts for data parsing, processing, and analysis, along with Jupyter notebooks for detailed exploration and visualization.

## Scripts and Notebooks

### Data Parsing (`data_parsing.py`)

The `data_parsing.py` script includes functions for parsing boat sales data. You can use it to calculate missing data info, replace missing categorical values, and more.

### Data Processing (`data_processing.py`)

The `data_processing.py` script provides functions for processing boat sales data. It includes functions for dropping missing numeric features, imputing missing values, and preparing data for machine learning modeling.

### Data Analysis (`data_analysis.py`)

The `data_analysis.py` script contains functions for analyzing boat sales data. It includes functions for exploring relationships between variables, performing statistical analysis, and generating insights.

### Jupyter Notebooks

1. **1_data_parsing.ipynb**: A notebook for detailed exploration of data parsing functions.
2. **2_data_processing.ipynb**: A notebook for processing boat sales data and preparing it for analysis.
3. **3_data_analysis.ipynb**: A notebook for in-depth analysis and visualization of boat sales data.

## Running Unit Tests

You can execute the unit tests for the functions using the `run_tests.py` script. Simply run the script to ensure the functionality of the code.
